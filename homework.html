    <div class="history">
        <h3><b>Founding and Kingdom (c. 753-509 BCE):</b></h3>
        <p>Rome was traditionally founded in 753 BCE by Romulus. Initially a small city-state ruled by kings, it was strategically located on the Tiber River, giving access to trade routes and fertile lands.</p>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Republic (509-27 BCE):</b></h3>
        <p>Rome became a republic after overthrowing its monarchy. Governance was based on a system of checks and balances with consuls, a senate, and popular assemblies. During this period, Rome expanded across the Italian peninsula through military conquest and alliances, establishing a legal and political framework that influenced later democracies.</p>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Empire (27 BCE-476 CE in the West):</b></h3>
        <p>Rome transitioned to an empire under Augustus in 27 BCE. At its height, it controlled much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Roman achievements included engineering marvels (roads, aqueducts, bridges), monumental architecture, law (Roman law became the foundation for many modern legal systems), and a unified currency and trade network.</p>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Culture and Civilization:</b></h3>
        <p>Roman language (Latin) shaped modern Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian). Roman literature, philosophy, and art influenced Western culture for centuries. Christianity spread throughout the empire, later becoming a dominant global religion.</p>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Fall and Legacy:</b></h3>
        <p>The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE due to internal instability, economic decline, and invasions. However, the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) persisted for nearly a thousand years. Rome’s legal, political, architectural, and cultural legacies profoundly shaped Europe and Western civilization, serving as a blueprint for governance, law, military strategy, urban planning, and culture.</p>
